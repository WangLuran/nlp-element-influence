# NLP Element Influence

Understanding the importance of the inputs on
the output is useful across many tasks. This
repository provides an information-theoretic frame-
work to analyse the influence of inputs for text
classification tasks. Natural language process-
ing (NLP) tasks take either a single element
input or multiple element inputs to predict an
output variable, where an element is a block
of text. Each text element has two compo-
nents: an associated semantic meaning and a
linguistic realization. Multiple-choice reading
comprehension (MCRC) and sentiment clas-
sification (SC) are selected to showcase the
framework.
